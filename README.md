# RGEOde
The aim of the RGEOde project was to develop a bioinformatics unit that could be implemented broadly, by not requiring any computer programming experience and using free software and publically-available data. Teaching materials were designed to present the content in a tutorial, interactive fashion that appeals to multiple student learning styles. The lesson sequence builds on gene expression concepts covered in high school biology, reinforcing student comprehension through bioinformatics analysis of gene expression microarray data using the R programming language.

# First public release of materials will coincide with NABT Workshop on 11 November 2017 [https://www.nabt.org/Events-2017-Conference]
